# lzbench compression benchmark web site

This is the web site to present results for the lzbench compression benchmark.

For local development, you can clone the repo and start a local web server with `python -m http.server`.
It has to be accessed through a real web server for the javascript to work, try `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`, whichever is accepted by your browser.

This was forked from the ``squash`` compression benchmark. An utility to use multiple compression algorithms and run benchmarks, like `lzbench` except it appears abandonned and I couldn't get it work. The visualizations are **fantastic** hence forking them.
